<h1>Kirsty's Favourite Movies</h1>

<h2>My Top Tier List</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Howl's Moving Castle</h3>
<p>One of my favourite Studio Ghilbi movies, I really enjoyed the book also by Diana Wynne Jones.  Very nostalgic of childhood.</p>

<h3>Bullet Train</h3>
<p>Fun and easy film set on a Shinkansen.  I love the interplay of childishness and violence, it was very well thought out and very easy to watch.</p>

<h3>Shrek</h3>
<p>Great classic.  Love the soundtrack and the twist on regular fairytale movies.</p>
